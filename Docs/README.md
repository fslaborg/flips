# Docute Starter

A simple and easy to use project to start writing documentation with [Docute](https://v3.docute.org/#/), the project can be served as is in any static file web server like `http-server` or just use the branch as the root of github pages and the files will be ready to serve: no build step required. 

### Writing docs locally
For local development, I am using [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) which watches changes for files while you are editing them and reloads the current page. To use this mode, run:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
