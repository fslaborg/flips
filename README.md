## Introduction

Flips is an F# library for modeling and solving Linear Programming (LP) and Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) problems. It is inspired by the work of the PuLP library for Python and the excellent Gurobi Python library. It builds on the work of the outstanding Google OR-Tools and OPTANO libraries. The currently available Solvers are Gurobi, CPLEX, GLOP, and CBC.

F# is a great language to work with but many of the existing APIs for modeling Optimization problems are heavily influenced by Object-Oriented concepts. While there is nothing wrong with OO, this is an attempt to take a functional-first approach to the problem.

This library tries to make the modeling of Optimization Models (LP/MIP) clean and simple. The idea was to make it straightforward for an Operation Researcher or Optimization domain expert to express their ideas in F#. These practitioners are used to working with Mathematical constructs like Sets, Sigma-notation, and summations. Reducing the mental distance between the mathematical formulation of problems and the F# representation was a key design goal.

F# developers should also find it comfortable to use this library. Over time I will be adding tutorials and training material on how to model Optimization Problems using this library. With a little training any F# developer will be able to add the powerful tool of Optimization to their repertoire.

### Optimization, What art thou?

The word "Optimization" is an overloaded term and is used in many domains. It can mean something as simple as, "We looked at the process and made some minor tweaks," all the way to more formal definitions found in [Mathematical Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization). Linear Programming (LP) and Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) are sub-fields of Mathematical Optimization. It is important to note that LP/MIP emerged as fields of study before Software Programming. The word "Programming" used to mean "Planning". Therefore, it is best to think of LP/MIP as tools for Mathematical Planning. These fields focus on answering the question: Given a set of decisions to be made, what is the best possible plan, while obeying a set of constraints?

The tools of Linear/Mixed-Integer Programming are underutilized. Businesses frequently have problems that would be trivially solved using these tools but instead use complex heuristics involving copy/paste in Excel files instead. There have been many instances where I have observed a domain-expert slaving away for hours at a time with a giant Excel file to answer the question, "What should we do?" After sitting down and talking with these domain-experts it becomes clear they have a planning problem which could be reduced to a 5-minute problem for a computer. There are at least two major reasons for the lack of adoption: lack of awareness and lack of tools.

#### Lack of Awareness

LP/MIP is typically found in Operations Research curriculum. In some cases, people are exposed to it when they take a course on Excel and are shown the Solver that is built into Excel as an add-in. The Solver found in Excel is great for small, simple problems but begins to become unwieldly as the complexity and size grow. You eventually need to graduate to more powerful and expressive tools but if you haven't studied LP/MIP, you may not be aware of them. This lack of awareness has lead LP/MIP being relegated to expert users who likely studied it more seriously in university.

#### Lack of Tools

When LP/MIP emerged, they were severely limited by the computational power of computers at the time. Eventually, computers become far more powerful and enormous advances in the underlying algorithms were made. We are now able to solve huge LP/MIP problems. Until recently though, to utilize that power you had to learn a specialized language to formulate your problems. This relegated the use of LP/MIP to those who had studied these domain-specific languages.

In the last few years Python has done an incredible service to the software development community by providing a gentle onramp to writing code. Combine Python with Jupyter notebooks and you have a powerful tool for experimenting without all the formalism of "professional" software development. There are some in the LP/MIP community who have recognized this trend and have created libraries for using LP/MIP from Python. I recommend looking at the work of [PuLP](https://github.com/coin-or/pulp) and the excellent [Gurobi Python library](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.0/quickstart_mac/py_python_interface.html).

### Why do we need Flips?

Many of the existing libraries for using LP/MIP are either array-based or heavily Object-Oriented. There is nothing wrong with these approaches, but they run counter to idiomatic F#. F# provides a rich set of tools for expressing problems and algorithms in a functional-first style. After spending several years working in F# and Mathematical Planning, it appeared that there was a gap in the market. A library was needed that allowed an F# developer to express their LP/MIP in a functional way.

Flips is intended to make building and solving LP/MIP problems in F# simple. The hope is that by filling in the gap between current LP/MIP libraries and F# developers the adoption of the awesome tool of LP/MIP will be accelerated.

### Intro Problem

For anyone not familiar with LP/MIP, the process of creating and solving a model is composed of the following steps:

1. Define Parameters: This is the input data for your model
2. Create Decisions: These are the choices that we want the Solver to make.
3. Define the Objective: This is how success is measured
4. Add Constraints: These are the rules that the Solver must objey for the solution to be valid
5. Solve the Model: We give the optimization model to the Solver for it to find the best solution.
6. Inspect the Result: Not all models are solvable. Depending on the formulation, there may be no solutions. We always check whether the Solver was able to find a solution to the model.

Let us go through an example problem to see how this works. We are managing a Food Truck and we need to figure out what ingredients we need to pack for the day. In this example we only sell Hamburgers and Hotdogs. Each Hamburger we sell provides us $1.50 in profit. Each Hotdog we sell provides $1.20 in profit. We only have enough Hamburger buns for up to 300 Hamburgers and only 200 buns for Hotdogs. The ingredients for a single Hamburger weight 0.5 kg and the ingredients for a Hotdog weigh 0.4 kg. Our Food Truck can only hold up to 500 kg. The question becomes, how many ingredients do we pack for Hamburgers and how many for Hotdogs? Let us answer this question by formulating an Optimization model.

```fsharp
open System
open Flips.Domain
open Flips.Solve

// Declare the parameters for our model
let hamburgerProfit = 1.50
let hotdogProfit = 1.20
let hamburgerBuns = 300.0
let hotdogBuns = 200.0
let hamburgerWeight = 0.5
let hotdogWeight = 0.4
let maxTruckWeight = 200.0
```

Next we need to create the Decisions for the Solver to make. Decisions come in three varities: Boolean, Integer, and Continuous. Every Decision must be given a name and a Lower and Upper bound. In the case of a Boolean Decision, the Lower and Upper bound is implictly 0 and 1. For the case of Integer or Continuous, the bounds must be provided. This tells the Solver what is the legal range of values the Decision can take on. Most real-world Decisions have some bound to them. It is rare that something can be positive or negative infinity. There are four functions for creating Decisions in the `Decision` module. 

```fsharp
create: (name:string) -> (decisionType:DecisionType) -> Decision
createBoolean: (name:string) -> Decision
createInteger: (name:string) -> (lowerBound:float) -> (upperBound:float) -> Decision
createContinuous: (name:string) -> (lowerBound:float) -> (upperBound:float) -> Decision
```

For simplicity we will use the `createContinuous` in our example to create the Decisions to represent the number of Hamburgers and Hotdogs we are going to pack.

```fsharp
// Create Decision Variable with a Lower Bound of 0.0 and an Upper Bound of Infinity
let numberOfHamburgers = Decision.createContinuous "NumberOfHamburgers" 0.0 infinity
let numberOfHotdogs = Decision.createContinuous "NumberOfHotDogs" 0.0 infinity
```

We then create the expression for measuring success. This is called an Objective Expression. It is a mathematical formula for calculating whatever it is that you want to maximize or minimize. In this case, it is the calculation for revenue. Once we have the Objective Expression, we create an `Objective` which contains the name of the objective, what our goal is (Maximize or Minimize), and the Objective Expression.

```fsharp
// Create the Linear Expression for the objective
let objectiveExpression = hamburgerProfit * numberOfHamburgers + hotdogProfit * numberOfHotdogs

// Create an Objective with the name "MaximizeRevenue" the goal of Maximizing
// the Objective Expression
let objective = Objective.create "MaximizeRevenue" Maximize objectiveExpression
```

We then must create the constraints which describe what is allowed. Whenever we create a `Constraint` we must provide a name and a `ConstraintExpression`. A `ConstraintExpression` is two `LinearExpression` with a comparison operator in between: `==`, `>==`, or `<==`.

> **Note:** Due to .NET reserving the normal comparison operators of `=`, `>=`, and `<=` for use with `IComparable` it was necessary to use a different set of operators. To keep it simple, it was decided to just add an additional equals sign so that there would not be conflict. This means when you want to create a `ConstraintExpression`, you use the following operators: `==`, `>==`, and `<==`.

```fsharp  
// Create a Constraint for the max number of Hamburger considering the number of buns
let maxHamburger = Constraint.create "MaxHamburger" (numberOfHamburgers <== hamburgerBuns)
// Create a Constraint for the max number of Hot Dogs considering the number of buns
let maxHotDog = Constraint.create "MaxHotDog" (numberOfHotdogs <== hotdogBuns)
// Create a Constraint for the Max combined weight of Hamburgers and Hotdogs
let maxWeight = Constraint.create "MaxWeight" (numberOfHotdogs * hotdogWeight + numberOfHamburgers * hamburgerWeight <== maxTruckWeight)
```

Now that we have an `Objective` and some `Constraint`s, we can create a `Model` and add the `Constraint`s to it.

```fsharp
// Create a Model type and pipe it through the addition of the constraitns
let model =
    Model.create objective
    |> Model.addConstraint maxHamburger
    |> Model.addConstraint maxHotDog
    |> Model.addConstraint maxWeight
```

To submit the `Model` to a solver we need to provide `SolverSettings`. Here we choose the use the CBC solver with a Max Duration of 10,000 ms. If you want to see the model written out as an LP file, you can provide a path to where you would like to see it written. Now that we have our `Model` and `SolverSettings`, we call the `solve` function in the `Solve` module to get the result.

```fsharp
// Create a Settings type which tells the Solver which types of underlying solver to use,
// the time alloted for solving, and whether to write an LP file to disk
let settings = {
    SolverType = SolverType.CBC
    MaxDuration = 10_000L
    WriteLPFile = None
}

// Call the `solve` function in the Solve module to evaluate the model
let result = solve settings model
```

The `solve` function returns a `SolveResult` which is a DU with two cases: Optimal or Suboptimal. If the `SolveResult` is the `Optimal` case, it will contain a `Solution`. If the `SolveResult` case is `Suboptimal`, it will hold a `string` which describes what went wrong. In this case the `SolveResult` case is `Optimal` so we can match the case and print out the solution values. The `Solution` type contains `DecisionResult` which is a `Map<Decision,float>`. `DecisionResult` tells you which values the `Solver` picked for the `Decision`s you provided it. The field in the `Solution` is `ObjectiveResult` which is a `float` which tells you how well the `Solver` was able to do.

```fsharp
printfn "-- Result --"

// Match the result of the call to solve
// If the model could not be solved it will return a `Suboptimal` case with a message as to why
// If the model could be solved, it will print the value of the Objective Function and the
// values for the Decision Variables
match result with
| Suboptimal msg -> printfn "Unable to solve. Error: %s" msg
| Optimal solution ->
    printfn "Objective Value: %f" solution.ObjectiveResult

    for (decision, value) in solution.DecisionResults |> Map.toSeq do
        let (DecisionName name) = decision.Name
        printfn "Decision: %s\tValue: %f" name value
```

If we run this code, we will get the following output

```console
-- Result --
Objective Value: 600.000000
Decision: NumberOfHamburgers    Value: 240.000000
Decision: NumberOfHotDogs       Value: 200.000000
Press any key to close...
```

The rows below the `-- Result --` line show the values the solver found. The solver estimates that we can achieve a profit of $600.00 if we pack for 240 Hamburgers and 200 Hotdogs. You can run this example problem for yourself by running the `FoodTruckExample` problem in the `Flips.Examples` project.

### Using Indices

While the above formulation did work, it does not scale automatically with the number of food items. A better way to formulate this problem would be to store parameter data and decision variables in `Map` instances and use product names as the keys. This means we add a new first step: define the indices. The steps to modeling are now:

1. Define the Indices/Keys for your data
2. Define your data as Maps using your defined Keys
3. Create Decision Variables Maps using your defined Keys
4. Formulating your Objective Function
5. Adding Constraints
6. Solving the Model

We now show how to formulate the problems using the F# `Map` type so that it can scale to an arbitrary number of different items.

```fsharp
// Declare the parameters for our model
let items = ["Hamburger"; "HotDog"]
let profit = Map.ofList [("Hamburger", 1.50); ("HotDog", 1.20)]
let maxIngredients = Map.ofList [("Hamburger", 300.0); ("HotDog", 200.0)]
let itemWeight = Map.ofList [("Hamburger", 0.5); ("HotDog", 0.4)]
let maxTruckWeight = 200.0

// Create Decision Variable Map<string,Decision> to represent how much of each item we should pack
// with a Lower Bound of 0.0 and an Upper Bound of Infinity
let numberOfItem =
    [for item in items do
        item, Decision.createContinuous (sprintf "NumberOf%s" item) 0.0 infinity]
    |> Map.ofList

// Create the Linear Expression for the objective
let objectiveExpression = List.sum [for item in items -> profit.[item] * numberOfItem.[item]]

// Create an Objective with the name "MaximizeRevenue" the goal of Maximizing
// the Objective Expression
let objective = Objective.create "MaximizeRevenue" Maximize objectiveExpression
    
// Create a Max Item Constraints
let maxItemConstraints =
    [for item in items ->
        Constraint.create (sprintf "MaxOf%s" item) (numberOfItem.[item] <== maxIngredients.[item])]

// Create a Constraint for the Max combined weight of Hamburgers and Hotdogs
let weightExpression = List.sum [for item in items -> itemWeight.[item] * numberOfItem.[item]]
let maxWeight = Constraint.create "MaxWeight" (weightExpression <== maxTruckWeight)

// Create a Model type and pipe it through the addition of the constraints
let model =
    Model.create objective
    |> Model.addConstraints maxItemConstraints
    |> Model.addConstraint maxWeight
```

We now have a formulation of the problem that will scale to an arbitrary number of items. This is a more maintainable formulation and will not require updating as the variety of items changes over time. Only the input data to the model formulation code need change.

## The Flips Domain

### Scalar

A `Scalar` is a single case DU which wraps a `float`. The reason for this was to ensure proper equality behavior. Equality is incredibly difficult with any floating-point type. In order to ensure that modeling works as intended it was necessary to wrap the `float` value and specify the equality behavior.

The `Scalar` type supports the basic algebraic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. Any time you perform an algebraic operation with a `Scalar` and a `float`, you will get a `Scalar` back. When perform an algebraic operation with a `Scalar` and a `Decision` you will get a `LinearExpression` back. The `LinearExpression` is the basic building block of Optimization Models. For more information on `LinearExpresion`, please refer to its section.

### Decision

A `Decision` represents a choice that the Solver needs to make. It is a DU with three cases: `Boolean`, `Integer`, and `Continuous`. The `Boolean` case is meant to model a True/False, Yes/No type of decision. Examples are whether to build a factory or not, whether to open a store or not, start a power plant or not, or any other type of decision where a state must be true or false and nothing in between. The `Integer` case represents a decision that can take on discrete values. When you create them, you must specify a Lower and Upper bound. The bounds are the limits for the Solver so that it knows what the legal range of values for the decision is. The `Continuous` case has Lower and Upper bounds like the `Integer` case except that any value within the bounds is allowed, not just the discrete values. `Continuous` decisions are the most common and should be the default for better performance from the Solver.

### LinearExpression

A `LinearExpression` is the addition of one or more `Scalar` or `Decision` values. It is meant to represent math expressions like [`2.3 + 3.4*x1 + 4.5*x2`] where `x1` and `x2` are `Decision`s. `LinearExpression`s are meant as the unit of compositions for Optimization Models. Constraints and Objectives are expressed in terms of `LinearExpression`s. The `LinearExpression` type forms a Monoid with the `+` operator.

### Constraint

A `Constraint` is composed of a Name and a comparison (`==`, `<==`, `>==`) of two `LinearExpression`s. The Name for a `Constraint` should be indicative of what it is controlling for. Best practice is to prefix a set of `Constraint` with an identifier followed by the indices that the individual `Constraint` correspond to. There is a `ConstraintBuilder` Computation Expression to streamline this.

### Objective

An `Objective` is composed of three parts: a `ObjectiveName`, a `ObjectiveSense`, and a `LinearExpression`. The `ObjectiveName` is meant to clarify what the goal of the Optimization Model is. For example, "MaximizeRevenue" or "MinimizeWaste" or "MaximizeSafety". The `ObjectiveName` has no bearing on what the Solver does. It is meant to document what the purpose of the Model was when it was written.

The `ObjectiveSense` tells the Solver whether it is trying to Maximize or Minimize the `LinearExpression` in the `Objective`. The `LinearExpression` is the way the Solver will measure success. It will either try to make the expression be as large as possible for `Maximize` or as small as possible for `Minimize`.

### Model

The `Model` type contains the full description of the problem. It holds the `Decision`s that need to be made, the `Constraint`s that must be adhered to, and the `Objective` that is trying to be achieved. An `Objective` must be provided when creating a `Model`. From there `Constraint`s can be added to the `Model` using the `Model.addConstraint` or `Model.addConstraints` functions. 

Once all the `Constraint`s have been added the `solve` function can be called. The `solve` function returns a `SolveResult` type. The `SolveResult` type is a DU with two cases: an `Optimal` case containing a `Solution` or the `Suboptimal` case containing an error message.

### Solution

In the case that the `Model` was solved succesfully, a `SolveResult` is returned containing a `Solution`. The `Solution` contains two things: DecisionResults and ObjectiveResult. The DecisionResults is a `Map<Decision,float>` which provides the value the Solver found for the given `Decision`. The ObjectiveResult is a `float` representing the final value of the `LinearExpression` for the `Objective`.

### Decision Builder

It is common to need to create a `Decision` which corresponds to a set of one or more indices. In order to streamline this work a Computatino Expression was created called `DecisionBuilder`. `DecisionBuilder` takes the prefix you would like to use for the names of the `Decision`s you are about to create. It then automatically adds meaningful suffixes which correspond to the index you are create the `Decision` for. Here is an example of how this works without the `DecisionBuilder` and then again with the `DecisionBuilder` to show the difference.

```fsharp
let indexes = [1..3]
let locations = ["CityA"; "CityB"; "CityC"]

// Creating a Map of decisions without the DecisionBuilder
let withoutDecisionBuilder =
    [for i in indexes do
        for l in locations ->
            let name = sprintf "Test|%i_%s" i l
            let decisionType = DecisionType.Continuous (0.0, infinity)
            (i, l), Decision.create name decisionType
    ] |> Map.ofList

// Creating a Map of decisions with the DecisionBuilder
let withDecisionBuilder =
    DecisionBuilder "Test" {
        for i in indexes do
            for l in locations ->
                Continuous (0.0, infinity)
    } |> Map.ofSeq
```

You will see that the `DecisionBuilder` removed some of the ceremony around naming and indexing the `Decision`s.

### Constraint Builder

Since the creation of constraints is such a common occurrence in modeling, a `ConstraintBuilder` Computation Expression (CE) was made to streamline the naming of constraints. The idea is that you give a prefix for the set of constraints you are going to create, and the Computation Expression takes care of naming the constraints you are creating. Here is a side by side comparison of creating constraints without and with the `ConstraintBuilder` CE. The results of both methods are equivalent. The method with `ConstraintBuilder` CE is more succinct. Over time, the added brevity is appreciated. This is showing how to create constraints across two dimensions: Items and Locations.

```fsharp
// How you would write the MaxItem constraints without `ConstraintBuilder`
let maxItemConstraints =
    [for item in items do
        for location in locations do
            let name = sprintf "MaxItem|%s_%s" item location
            Constraint.create name (numberOfItem.[item,location] <== maxIngredients.[item])]

// The equivalent statement using a `ConstraintBuilder`
let maxItemConstraints = ConstraintBuilder "MaxItem" {
    for item in items do
        for location in locations -> 
            numberOfItem.[item,location] <== maxIngredients.[item]
}
```

### The `sum` and `sumAll` Functions

A couple of convenience functions were added for summing up the values held inside of collections. The `sum` functions calls the `Sum` method defined on the type. The `sumAll` functions is meant to sum a collection of summable types (Ex: `List<float>`). These are to help a Domain Expert write code that more closely matches the math notation of optimization problems.

## SliceMaps

### What is Slicing

Up to this point we have been using the built in `Map` type for holding our data and Decision Variables. One of the challenges we will quickly run into when modeling optimization problems is that it is common to operate on subsets of values, often referred to as slices. For these reasons it is common to use N-dimensional Arrays so that you can take slices across different dimensions. Just using the built-in F# `Array` type has limitations though since you can only index the values with an `int`. What we really want is something that allows us to look up a value using an arbitrary index type but also allows us to select ranges of values.

So, we need something that has `Map` like lookup but also allows us to slice across different dimensions...? I know, let us create a new type, a `SliceMap`!

> **Aside**: There was an attempt to simply extend the existing F# `Map` type. Ultimately the combination of features that was required in `SliceMap` made that not possible. Specifically, `SliceMap` is not a single type but a family of types: `SMap`, `SMap2`, `SMap3`, `SMap4`. The numbers correspond to the dimensionality of the `Key` used in the `Map`. `SMap` is keyed by a single value. `SMap2` is keyed by a tuple of two values. `SMap3` is keyed by a tuple of three values and so forth. These types also have some unique interactions that could not be implemented with just extending the built in `Map` type.

### Types of SliceMaps

SliceMaps are not a single type, they are a family of types akin to Tuples. Tuples can have any number elements: 2, 3, 4, etc. SliceMaps are like tuples in that they have different levels of dimensionality. An `SMap` has a key which is a single element. An `SMap2` has a key which is made up of two elements. An `SMap3` has a key which is made up of three elements. The family of SliceMaps goes up to 4-element keys currently. The type signatures for SliceMaps are the following:

```fsahrp
SMap<'Key, 'Value>
SMap2<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Value>
SMap3<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Key3, 'Value>
SMap4<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Key3, 'Key4, 'Value>
```

> **Note:** If I come across a compelling reason to create SMap5, SMap6, etc. I will. At this time, I have not come across a real-world problem which would benefit for having higher dimensional SliceMaps.

SliceMaps support the ability to perform lookup by key, just like the standard F# `Map` type.

```fsharp
// 1D SliceMap
let x1 = SMap.ofList [for i in 1..3 -> i, float i]
x1.[1] // Returns val it : int = 1

// 2D SliceMap
let x2 = [for i in 1..3 do
            for j in 1..3 ->
                    (i, j), i + j]
        |> SMap2.ofList
x2.[1, 2] // Returns val it : int = 3
```

The real power of SliceMaps for Optimization Modeling comes from their ability to "slice" the values across the dimensions of the key. This takes the ability to slice `Array` and `List` but extends it. The slicing built into F# is powerful but it is constrained to a limited set of slicing types. SliceMaps support the same types of slices but offer more advanced filtering criteria which is useful in the Optimization domain.


### Types of Slicing

SliceMaps have several different types of slices they support:

- `All` : All Keys will match
- `Equal x` : Key must be equal to `x`
- `GreaterThan x` : Key values in this dimension must be greater than `x`
- `GreaterOrEqual x` : Key values in this dimension must be greater or equal to `x`
- `LessThan x` : Key values in this dimension must be less than `x`
- `LessOrEqual x` : Key values in this dimension must be less or equal to `x`
- `Between (x, y)` : Key value in this dimension must be between `x` and `y` (inclusive)
- `In (x:Set<'a>)` : Key value in this dimension must be contained in the set `x`
- `NotIn (x:Set<'a>)` : Key value in this dimension must not be in this set `x`
- `Where ('a -> bool)` : Key value in this dimension must return true for the predicate

#### `GreaterThan` Slicing

This creates a SliceMap where the Key element is greater than the corresponding value.

```fsharp
let x = SMap.ofList [for i in 1..5 -> i, i]
x.[GreaterThan 3] 
// Returns SMap<int,int> = SMap map [(4, 4); (5, 5)]
```

#### `GreaterOrEqual` Slicing

This creates a SliceMap where the Key element is greater than or equal the corresponding value.

```fsharp
let x = SMap.ofList [for i in 1..5 -> i, i]
x.[GreaterOrEqual 3] 
// Returns SMap map [(3, 3); (4, 4); (5, 5)]
```

#### `LessThan` Slicing

This creates a SliceMap where the Key element is greater than the corresponding value.

```fsharp
let x = SMap.ofList [for i in 1..5 -> i, i]
x.[LessThan 3] 
// Returns SMap<int,int> = SMap map [(1, 1); (2, 2)]
```

#### `LessOrEqual` Slicing

This creates a SliceMap where the Key element is greater than the corresponding value.

```fsharp
let x = SMap.ofList [for i in 1..5 -> i, i]
x.[LessOrEqual 3] 
// Returns SMap<int,int> = SMap map [(1, 1); (2, 2); (3, 3)]
```

#### `Between` Slicing

This creates a SliceMap where the Key element is between the Lower Bound and Upper Bound inclusive.

```fsharp
let x = SMap.ofList [for i in 1..5 -> i, i]
x.[Between (3, 4)] 
// Returns SMap<int,int> = SMap map [(3, 3); (4, 4)]
```

#### `In` Slicing

The `In` slice takes a set of values. If the Key value for that dimension is in that set, then the filter will include the entry.

```fsharp
let x = SMap.ofList [for i in 1..5 -> i, i]
let indexSet = Set.ofList [2; 4]
x.[In indexSet] 
// Returns SMap<int,int> = SMap map [(2, 2); (4, 4)]
```

#### `NotIn` Slicing

The `NotIn` slice takes a set of values. If the Key value for that dimension is NOT in that set, then the filter will include the entry.

```fsharp
let x = SMap.ofList [for i in 1..5 -> i, i]
let indexSet = Set.ofList [2; 4]
x.[NotIn indexSet] 
// Returns SMap<int,int> = SMap map [(1, 1); (3, 3); (5, 5)]
```

#### `All` Slicing

The `All` Slice is used to select all of the values in a given dimension. It is the akin of a wildcard.

```fsharp
let x1 = SMap.ofList [for i in 1..5 -> i, i]
x1.[All] 
// Return SMap map [(1, 1); (2, 2); (3, 3); ... ]
```

In the case of an `SMap` (1-dimensional SliceMap) the `All` slicing is not exciting. It is simply returning all the values. It becomes more useful when dealing with higher dimensional SliceMaps.

#### `Where` Slicing

 The `Where` slice is provided to give you the ability to slice with some arbitrary predicate. You provide a function which will be used to evaluate the key along the dimension. For the keys where the predicate returns `true`, the entry will be returned. Where the predicate returns `false` the value will not be included in the returned SliceMap.

```fsharp
let x = SMap.ofList [for i in 1..5 -> i, i]
let isDivisibleBy2 x = x % 2 = 0
x.[Where isDivisibleBy2] 
// Return SMap<int,int> = SMap map [(2, 2); (4, 4)]
```

### Slicing for 2D, 3D, and 4D SliceMaps

The examples above have shown what the slicing behavior is for a 1D SliceMap, a `SMap`. While useful for a single dimensional SliceMap, the utility of slicing is increased when you have higher dimensional data. When working with 2, 3, and 4 dimensional SliceMaps, it is important to note that the returned keys and values must meet all the conditions of the slices. Let us see how this plays out with a `SMap2`.

```fsharp
let x = SMap2.ofList [
    (1, "a"), 2.0; (1, "b"), 2.0; (1, "c"), 2.1; 
    (2, "a"), 3.0; (2, "b"), 1.0; (2, "c"), 2.3; 
    (3, "a"), 4.0; (3, "b"), 1.5; (3, "c"), 2.4; 
]
x.[GreaterThan 1, LessThan "b"] 
// Returns SMap2 map [((2, a), 3); 
//                    ((3, a), 4)]
```

In this case we are saying that the keys of the first dimension must be greater than 1 and the keys of the second dimension must be less than "b". This leaves only two entries from the original `SMap2`. Let us look at another example.

```fsharp
let x = SMap2.ofList [
    (1, "a"), 2.0; (1, "b"), 2.0; (1, "c"), 2.1; 
    (2, "a"), 3.0; (2, "b"), 1.0; (2, "c"), 2.3; 
    (3, "a"), 4.0; (3, "b"), 1.5; (3, "c"), 2.4; 
]
x.[GreaterOrEqual 2, LessOrEqual "b"] 
// Returns SMap2 map [((2, "a"), 3.0); ((2, "b"), 1.0); 
//                    ((3, "a"), 4.0); ((3, "b"), 1.5)]
```

Here we are only returning the entries where the value of the first key dimension is greater or equal to 2 and the value of the second dimension is less or equal to "b". The great thing about F# is that you can use any type for the key dimensions if they support `comparison`.

### Sub-setting SliceMaps

In many mainstream programming languages, programmers are not required to think about the dimensionality of their data. Most languages will have scalar values and collections of values. Though we may not think about it, a Scalar (`int`, `string`, `float`) value is a 0-Dimensional piece of data. When we add collections, the dimensionality can increase. An `Array` in F# is a 1-Dimensional storage of data. The same can be said of `Map` and `List`. Now, F# also has 2D and 3D Array. To look up data in these data structures you need to specify multiple index values because data is organized in multiple dimensions.

Now, let us see what item look and slicing looks like for a 2D Array in F#.

```fsharp
let x = array2D [ [ 1; 2]; [3; 4] ] // Create a 2D Array
// Returns int [,] = [[1; 2]
//                    [3; 4]]
let y = x.[1, 1] // Select an element
// Returns val y : int = 4
let xSlice = x.[*, 1] // Take all rows, but only the second column
// Returns val xSlice : int [] = [|2; 4|]
```

At first, we create our 2D Array `x`. You will see that `x` is a 2D Array by its type signature, `int [,]`. We then assign `y` the value at row index `1` and column index `1`. You will notice that `y` is 0-Dimensional, it is a Scalar. We then assign `xSlice` a slice of `x` by taking all the rows but only the column at index `1`. You will notice that `xSlice` is a 1-Dimensional array.

What I am trying to drive home is that when you look up an item or slice an Array, you can get different dimensionality of data. SliceMaps have the same behavior as F# Arrays. Let us walk through some examples using a 2-dimensional SliceMap, a `SMap2`.

```fsharp
// Create our `SMap2`
let x = SMap2.ofList [
    (1, "a"), 2.0; (1, "b"), 2.0; (1, "c"), 2.1; 
    (2, "a"), 3.0; (2, "b"), 1.0; (2, "c"), 2.3; 
    (3, "a"), 4.0; (3, "b"), 1.5; (3, "c"), 2.4; 
]
let a = x.[1, "a"] // Select a single element
// val a : float = 2.0
```

Notice that `a` is a Scalar, a 0-Dimensional piece of data

```fsharp
// Slice across the first dimension, select only the "a" values in the second
let b = x.[GreaterThan 1, "a"] 
// val b : SMap<int,float> = SMap map [(2, 3); (3, 4)]
```

Here `b` no longer has the second-dimension index. It is an `SMap`. This is because we selected only the data where the second index was equal to "a".

```fsharp
// Slice across the first and second dimensions
let c = x.[GreaterThan 1, LessThan "b"]
// val c : SMap2<int,string,float> = SMap2 map [((2, a), 3); ((3, a), 4)]
```

Note that `c` is a subset of `x` but it is still 2-dimensional, an `SMap2`. This type of behavior holds true for all the SliceMaps.

### Operators for SliceMaps

SliceMaps support scalar multiplication using `*`.

```fsharp
let x = SMap.ofList [for i in 1..3 -> i, float i]

> x * 2.0
// Returns SMap<int,float> = SMap map [(1, 2.0); (2, 4.0); (3, 6.0)]
```

SliceMaps can also be added together. In the case where the keys match, the underlying values are added together. In the cases where the key exists in only one map, the value is still returned. The assumption is that the value in the other SliceMap was a `Zero` equivalent. The dimensionality of the SliceMap must match and the key types must align as well.

```fsharp
let x = SMap.ofList [for i in 1..3 -> i, i]
let y = SMap.ofList [for i in 2..5 -> i, i]
x + y 
// Returns SMap<int,int> = SMap map [(1, 1); (2, 4); (3, 6); (4, 4); (5, 5)]
```

Finally, SliceMaps support element-wise multiplication using the `.*` operator. This operator was first seen in MatLab but has been adopted by other languages as well. The SliceMaps will have their values multiplied together where the keys match. When the keys do not match, no value is returned. This behavior is similar to inner-joins in SQL. The behavior is intended to be the same as the [Hadamard Opertor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_product_(matrices)) in Linear Algebra. The difference is that SliceMaps can be keyed by any type that supports `comparison`, not just `int`.

```fsharp
let x = SMap.ofList [for i in 1..3 -> i, i]
let y = SMap.ofList [for i in 2..5 -> i, i]
x .* y 
// Return SMap<int,int> = SMap map [(2, 4); (3, 9)]
```

The `.*` becomes incredibly useful in formulating Constraints as you will see in future examples.

#### Broadcasting for SliceMaps

The `.*` operator also supports the idea of Broadcasting. This concept is similar to Broadcasting in the [Numpy Library](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/theory.broadcasting.html#array-broadcasting-in-numpy) and the [Julia language](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/arrays/#Broadcasting-1). The idea is that when performing the element-wise multiplication of two SliceMaps of different dimensions, the values are repeated along the unmatched dimension. This behavior is not exactly the same as what happens in Numpy and Julia, but the concept is the same.

Here is an example of element-wise multiplication of a `SMap` and a `SMap2`.

```fsharp
let x = SMap2.ofList [
    (1, "a"), 1.0; (1, "b"), 2.0; (1, "c"), 3.0; 
    (2, "a"), 4.0; (2, "b"), 5.0; (2, "c"), 6.0; 
    (3, "a"), 7.0; (3, "b"), 8.0; (3, "c"), 9.0; 
]

let y = SMap.ofList [(1, 1.0); (2, 2.0); (3, 3.0)]

y .* x
// Returns 
// SMap2 map [((1, "a"),  1.0); ((1, "b"),  2.0); ((1, "c"),  3.0);
//            ((2, "a"),  8.0); ((2, "b"), 10.0); ((2, "c"), 12.0);
//            ((3, "a"), 21.0); ((3, "b"), 24.0); ((3, "c"), 27.0)];}
```

You will notice that where the key of `y` matches the first element of the key for `x`, the values are multiplied. The resulting type is still a 2-dimensional SliceMap, `SMap2`. Something important to note is that in the `.*` operator is not commutative (i.e. positioning matters) for SliceMaps of different dimensions. If you tried the following, you would get a compiler error saying no overloads can be found.

```fsharp
x .* y // No matching operator can be found
```

When broadcasting with the `.*` operator, it is required that the types used for the keys to line up. In the first case, the key for `y` is an `int`. `y` is on the left side of `x` so it is comparing to the first element of the key for `x`. The type of the first element of the key for `x` is an `int` therefore you can use `.*`.

When you move `y` to the right side, the `.*` operator is checking the second element (or right-most element) of the key for `x`. In this case, the type of the second element of the `x` key is a `string`. The types do not match. Let us create a new `SMap` using a `string` for the key and try this again.

```fsharp
let x = SMap2.ofList [
    (1, "a"), 1.0; (1, "b"), 2.0; (1, "c"), 3.0; 
    (2, "a"), 4.0; (2, "b"), 5.0; (2, "c"), 6.0; 
    (3, "a"), 7.0; (3, "b"), 8.0; (3, "c"), 9.0; 
]
let z = SMap.ofList [("a", 1.0); ("b", 2.0); ("c", 3.0)]

x .* z
// Returns
// SMap2 map [((1, "a"), 1.0); ((1, "b"),  4.0); ((1, "c"),  9.0);
//            ((2, "a"), 4.0); ((2, "b"), 10.0); ((2, "c"), 18.0);
//            ((3, "a"), 7.0); ((3, "b"), 16.0); ((3, "c"), 27.0)];}

z .* x // Compiler error: No matching operator can be found
```

You will notice now that the value in `x` is multiplied by the value in `z` where the second element of the key for `x` matches. The requirement for broadcasting can be summarized with these type signatures

```fsharp
SMap<'Key1, 'Value> .* SMap2<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Value>
SMap2<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Value> .* SMap<'Key2, 'Value>

SMap<'Key1, 'Value> .* SMap3<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Key3, 'Value>
SMap3<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Key3, 'Value> .* SMap<'Key3, 'Value>

SMap<'Key1, 'Value> .* SMap4<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Key3, 'Key4 'Value>
SMap4<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Key3, 'Key4, 'Value> .* SMap<'Key4, 'Value>

SMap2<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Value> .* SMap3<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Key3, 'Value>
SMap3<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Key3, 'Value> .* SMap2<'Key2, 'Key3, 'Value>

SMap2<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Value> .* SMap4<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Key3, 'Key4, 'Value>
SMap4<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Key3, 'Key4, 'Value> .* SMap2<'Key3, 'Key4, 'Value>

SMap3<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Key3, 'Value> .* SMap4<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Key3, 'Key4, 'Value>
SMap4<'Key1, 'Key2, 'Key3, 'Key4, 'Value> .* SMap3<'Key2, 'Key3, 'Key4, 'Value> 
```

The important thing to remember, when multiplying a high-dimensional SliceMap by a lower-dimensional SliceMap, the keys used for matching are dependent on the side of the lower-dimensional SliceMap. If the lower-dimensional SliceMap is on the left then it is the first elements of the keys that must match. If the lower-dimensional SliceMap is on the right, then the last elements of the keys must match.

Using the `.*` operator with SliceMaps of different dimensions will always yield a SliceMap of the higher dimensionality. `SMap .* SMap2` will yield a `SMap2`. `SMap2 .* SMap3` will yield a `SMap3` etc.

### Slicing and Domain Driven Design

One of the most powerful facilities of F# is the ability to accurately model a domain. Instead of a `string` just being a string, it is a City Name. Instead of a `int` just being an `int`, it is an Index. This is often done using Single-Case Discriminated Unions. The topic of Domain Driven Design is beyond the scope of this intro. For further reading, please refer to the excellent book [Domain Modeling Made Functional](https://pragprog.com/book/swdddf/domain-modeling-made-functional) by Scott Wlaschin.

For our use case, the use of Single-Case DUs allows us to keep track of what the primitive types (`int`, `float`, `string`) correspond to. It is highly encouraged to wrap these primitives in single-case DUs when they are being used as keys in SliceMaps. The slicing behavior still work as you would expect.

```fsharp
type City = City of string
type Index = Index of int
let x = SMap2.ofList [
    (Index 1, City "a"), 2.0; (Index 1, City "b"), 2.0; (Index 1, City "c"), 2.1; 
    (Index 2, City "a"), 3.0; (Index 2, City "b"), 1.0; (Index 2, City "c"), 2.3; 
    (Index 3, City "a"), 4.0; (Index 3, City "b"), 1.5; (Index 3, City "c"), 2.4; 
]
x.[GreaterOrEqual (Index 2), LessOrEqual (City "b")]
// Returns SMap2 map [((Index 2, City "a"), 3.0); ((Index 2, City "b"), 1.0);
//                    ((Index 3, City "a"), 4.0); ((Index 3, City "b"), 1.5)]
```

You can see that the slicing behavior understands it needs to operate on the inner value of the single-case DU. This is due to the magic of F#. While the wrapping of the primitives in single-case DUs may feel over the top for simple modeling, it has payed dividends in real-world scenarios.

### Example Using SliceMaps

Sometimes the best way to see the utility of a new tool is to experience working on a problem without it. Let us take our Food Cart problem and add some complexity. Now we are not managing a single food cart but multiple. We have three different locations we are managing, and we have added Pizza to the menus. Each food cart has a different weight limit and a different profit amount per item.

```fsharp
// Declare the parameters for our model
let items = ["Hamburger"; "HotDog"; "Pizza"]
let locations = ["Woodstock"; "Sellwood"; "Portland"]
let profit = 
    [
        (("Woodstock", "Hamburger"), 1.50); (("Sellwood", "Hamburger"), 1.40); (("Portland", "Hamburger"), 1.90)
        (("Woodstock", "HotDog"   ), 1.20); (("Sellwood", "HotDog"   ), 1.50); (("Portland", "HotDog"   ), 1.80)
        (("Woodstock", "Pizza"    ), 2.20); (("Sellwood", "Pizza"    ), 1.70); (("Portland", "Pizza"    ), 2.00)
    ] |> Map.ofList

let maxIngredients = Map.ofList [("Hamburger", 900.0); ("HotDog", 600.0); ("Pizza", 400.0)]
let itemWeight = Map.ofList [("Hamburger", 0.5); ("HotDog", 0.4); ("Pizza", 0.6)]
let maxTruckWeight = Map.ofList [("Woodstock", 200.0); ("Sellwood", 300.0); ("Portland", 280.0) ]

// Create Decision Variable which is keyed by the tuple of Item and Location.
// The resulting type is a Map<(string*string),Decision> 
// to represent how much of each item we should pack for each location
// with a Lower Bound of 0.0 and an Upper Bound of Infinity
let numberOfItem =
    [for item in items do
        for location in locations do
            let decName = sprintf "NumberOf_%s_At_%s" item location
            let decision = Decision.createContinuous decName 0.0 infinity
            (location, item), decision]
    |> Map.ofList

// Create the Linear Expression for the objective
let objectiveExpression = 
    [for item in items do
        for location in locations ->
            profit.[location, item] * numberOfItem.[location, item]]
    |> List.sum            

// Create an Objective with the name "MaximizeRevenue" the goal of Maximizing
// the Objective Expression
let objective = Objective.create "MaximizeRevenue" Maximize objectiveExpression

// Create Total Item Maximum constraints for each item
let maxItemConstraints =
    [for item in items do
        // The total of the Item is the sum across the Locations
        let locationSum = List.sum [for location in locations -> numberOfItem.[location, item]]
        let name = sprintf "MaxItemTotal|%s" item
        Constraint.create name (locationSum <== maxIngredients.[item])
    ]


// Create a Constraint for the Max combined weight of items for each Location
let maxWeightConstraints = 
    [for location in locations -> 
        let weightSum = List.sum [for item in items -> itemWeight.[item] * numberOfItem.[location, item]]
        let name = sprintf "MaxTotalWeight|%s" location
        Constraint.create name (weightSum <== maxTruckWeight.[location])
    ]

// Create a Model type and pipe it through the addition of the constraints
let model =
    Model.create objective
    |> Model.addConstraints maxItemConstraints
    |> Model.addConstraints maxWeightConstraints
```

When we create our `maxItemConstraints` and `maxWeightConstraints` we are having to sum the decisions across a new dimension. For the `maxItemsConstraints` we must sum the items across the Location dimension:

```fsharp
let locationSum = List.sum [for location in locations -> numberOfItem.[location, item]]
```

For the `maxWeightConstraints` we have to sum across the Items dimension:

```fsharp
let weightSum = List.sum [for item in items -> itemWeight.[item] * numberOfItem.[location, item]]
```

In this example this is not so bad but imagine problems where the dimensionality is higher. You end up having nested `List` comprehensions. This summation across dimensions is so common that the `SliceMap` family of types was created. Let us revisit the problem but we will use SliceMaps instead of the built in `Map` type. If the Key for the data is a single dimension, we will use an `SMap`. If the key is two dimensional, we will use an `SMap2`.

```fsharp
// Declare the parameters for our model
let items = ["Hamburger"; "HotDog"; "Pizza"]
let locations = ["Woodstock"; "Sellwood"; "Portland"]
let profit = 
    [
        (("Woodstock", "Hamburger"), 1.50); (("Sellwood", "Hamburger"), 1.40); (("Portland", "Hamburger"), 1.90)
        (("Woodstock", "HotDog"   ), 1.20); (("Sellwood", "HotDog"   ), 1.50); (("Portland", "HotDog"   ), 1.80)
        (("Woodstock", "Pizza"    ), 2.20); (("Sellwood", "Pizza"    ), 1.70); (("Portland", "Pizza"    ), 2.00)
    ] |> SMap2.ofList

let maxIngredients = SMap.ofList [("Hamburger", 900.0); ("HotDog", 600.0); ("Pizza", 400.0)]
let itemWeight = SMap.ofList [("Hamburger", 0.5); ("HotDog", 0.4); ("Pizza", 0.6)]
let maxTruckWeight = SMap.ofList [("Woodstock", 200.0); ("Sellwood", 300.0); ("Portland", 280.0) ]

let numberOfItem =
    [for item in items do
        for location in locations do
            let decName = sprintf "NumberOf_%s_At_%s" item location
            let decision = Decision.createContinuous decName 0.0 infinity
            (location, item), decision]
    |> SMap2.ofList

// Use the .* operator to perform an element-wise multiplication of the two SliceMaps
// Sum the result of the element-wise multiplication using the `sum` function.
// The `sum` function calls the `sum` method of the type
let objectiveExpression = sum (profit .* numberOfItem)

let objective = Objective.create "MaximizeRevenue" Maximize objectiveExpression

// Create Total Item Maximum constraints for each item
let maxItemConstraints =
    [for item in items do
        let name = sprintf "MaxItemTotal|%s" item
        Constraint.create name (sum numberOfItem.[All, item] <== maxIngredients.[item])
    ]

// Create a Constraint for the Max combined weight of items for each Location
let maxWeightConstraints = 
    [for location in locations -> 
        let name = sprintf "MaxTotalWeight|%s" location
        Constraint.create name (sum (itemWeight .* numberOfItem.[location, All]) <== maxTruckWeight.[location])
    ]

// Create a Model type and pipe it through the addition of the constraints
let model =
    Model.create objective
    |> Model.addConstraints maxItemConstraints
    |> Model.addConstraints maxWeightConstraints
```

We can see that things look a little different now. The first change is that we are storing our data in a `SMap` or `SMap2`. All the SliceMaps support being created from a `List`, `Seq`, or `Array`. This behavior is the same as the equivalent functions for `Map`. You can even create a SliceMap from a `Map` if the dimensionality of the `'Key` matches what the SliceMap is expecting.

The next major change is in the `objectiveExpression` creation:

```fsharp
let objectiveExpression = sum (profit .* numberOfItem)
```

Here we are using two of the features that SliceMaps provide: summation and element-wise multiplication. The `.*` operator is an element-wise multiplication of the values in the SliceMaps. When the keys match in both SliceMaps, the values are multiplied together. In the cases where the keys do not match, nothing is returned. If you are familiar with SQL, this behavior is the equivalent of an inner-join. The `.*` comes from MATLAB and has been implemented in other languages. It is the [Hadamard Opertor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_product_(matrices)) if you are curious.

The `sum` function is a convenience function to make modeling more streamlined. It can only be used on types which have a `sum` method declared on them. It simply looks at the type and calls its associated `sum` method. All the SliceMaps have a `sum` method. When sum is called, all the values in the SliceMap are summed together using the `+` operator. SliceMaps were intended to be used with types which implement `+`, `*`, and `Zero`. The mathematical term is a [Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(mathematics)).

The next change we see in the model formulation is in the creation of `maxItemConstraints`. Specifically, on the line where we create the constraint.

```fsharp
Constraint.create name (sum numberOfItem.[All, item] <== maxIngredients.[item])
```

We are using the slicing capability of SliceMaps. For this constraint we are wanting to sum how much of a given Item we are sending across all the Locations. Before this was done using a List comprehension. Here we are slicing and then summing the resulting SliceMap. Remember that the first dimension to the `numberOfItem` SliceMap is the Location. This expression, `numberOfItem.[All, item]`, is saying to select items in the SliceMap for `All` the locations but only where the `item` key matches. This slicing then returns a new SliceMap. The returned SliceMap is summed to form the left-hand side of our Constraint Expression.
