# Flips Example: Stock Portfolio Optimization

Example inspired by [Pluralsight course](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/numerical-optimization-techniques) (Chapter 4: Implementing Linear Programming in Excel).

Imagine you want to buy shares and you are considering 10 companies:
AAPL, ADBE, CVX, GOOG, IBM, MDLZ, MSFT, NFLX, ORCL, SBUX.  

Which shares should be taken into account and in which proportions in order to:

- minimize the risk
- achieve at least 2.5% of return?

The result shows the percentage of the portfolio share values.
